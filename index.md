<h2>Probabity of Winning</h2>
<h3>80% - KKR
PBKS - 20%</h3>
<p>I personally think that KKR would win because they have a good set of wins a good set of players. While PBKS also have a chance of winning if their bad luck streak gets over. Currently KKR are on 4th at the points table where PBKS are at 6th at the points table. Let's see if today Mayank Agarwal will be able to play after he was not in the squad XI vs MI who dominated PBKS. Run-scorer KL Rahul might be able to retrieve his title after getting 33 runs in this match.
